1,2,"The collaborative programming task required students to use MATLAB to 
design an application that could predict the tensile stiffness parameters of the plate-like 
mechanical metamaterials based on back propagation (BP) neural network algorithms. "
2,3,"Assigned programming tasks throughout the classes. 
The completed assignments were collected and assessed 
based on code quality, adherence to programming prin ciples, and correctness of implementation. "
3,4,"Students practice the concepts covered in the lecture in weekly 
programming assignments (11 programming assignments over the semester). The 
programming assignments were to be solved individually by each student, thus receiving aid 
(other than from the TAs), accessing Q&Asites, and generative AI, were prohibited. "
