1,1,Students voluntarily participated in the experiment and provided their data,49,"experienced the instruc tional methodology, where students interacted with the ChatGPT-assisted platform to learn introductory programming concepts.",36,"adhered to the conventional teaching model, with a teacher employing slides and lectures to convey the concepts."
2,2,"The participants were 55 graduate students, including 13 doctoral students and 42 
master students. Students were arranged into 27 groups (two or three students per group). ",13,"ChatGPT intelligent feedback was offered tostudent groups. Due to 
policy restriction, the research team used ChatGPT to generate textual feedback, generated a 
video based on the ChatGPT feedback text, and used a virtual character to present the 
feedback content ",14,"The instructor provided manual, text-based feedback that included five 
dimen sions: correctness, readability, efficiency, maintainability, and compliance "
