1,1,Explores using ChatGPT as a teacher who assists lecturers for a Python programming course during class time.,"Firstly, students showed higher engagement and involvement in the learning process. Secondly, the instructor had more time available to address student questions directly. Additionally, we personalized examples for each student, ensuring tailored learning experiences that were concise and aided in understanding the explained concepts.",How it can handle the token limitation of OpenAIfs API and requiring further prompt engineering research in this area.
2,2,Compare the effects of traditional manual feedback from the instructor with the intelligent feedback generated by ChatGPT.,"The results indicated no significant differences in studentsf programming knowledge acquisition and group-level programming product quality between the two conditions. However, ChatGPT intelligent feedback facilitated studentsf regulation-oriented collaborative programming, while instructor manual feedback facilitated cognition-oriented collaborative discussions."," Due to technical constraints, the instructor posed questions about studentsf codes 
to ChatGPT and finally generated ChatGPT intelligent feedback. Students did not 
have direct interaction with ChatGPT to propose personalized and continuous questions. Despite controlling for studentsf precourse programming 
knowledge, we did not have rigorous controls on individual prior knowledge and initial 
programming skills. we did not implement a strict mechanism to review and verify the 
feedback generated by AI before presenting it to students. "
3,3,Investigate the effectiveness of the peer instruction model with Artificial Intelligence as a virtual peer in computer programming courses.,The integration of AI (ChatGPT) as a virtual peer in the peer instruction model improved student performance in programming skills and conceptual understanding compared to traditional instruction methods.,"Firstly, the study was conducted in a controlled edcational environment and may not fully represent real-world scenarios. Secondly, the study focused on a specific computer programming course and may not generalize to other subject areas. Lastly, the study duration was limited, and long-term effects of the peer instruction model with AI could not be assessed."
4,4,Shed light on ChatGPTfs potential influence on their learning outcomes.,"Did not reveal a pronounced or statistically significant impact of ChatGPT on the 
studentfs learning performance.","The active engagement level of participants with ChatGPT. While we designated 
groups specifically for ChatGPTusage, not all participants in these groups utilized the tool. 
Limited to a few hours and encompassing only three tasks, the results predominantly shed 
light on short-term interactions with ChatGPT. Observation bias, where participants might 
modify their behavior due to the awareness of being observed. To counteract this, we provided 
students with the flexibility to conduct the study at a time that was most convenient for them 
and in their preferred locations. "
